Create a functioning calculator

Using the HTML, CSS, and Javascript skills I've learned through The Odin Project I created a calculator that is able to handle basic functions. 

The calculator is able to perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division with both integers and floating point numbers. It is also able to evaluate more than a single pair of numbers at a time. 

I also added keyboard support for the calculator so it is able to perform all of the mentioned functions using the keyboard. 

The calculator was styled using CSS.
